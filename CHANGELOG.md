# Changelog

## 0.1.2 — 2026-11-11

- New: `context --fix` (and `all --fix`) writes the `.aiignore`
  suggestions into `<path>/.aiignore` instead of only printing them —
  entries already there are left alone, nothing else in the file is
  touched, and no file is created when there is nothing to add. The fix
  outcome is included in `--json` output.
- Fix: the context scan now honours the repo's `.aiignore` — files it
  lists are excluded from the scan entirely, so applying the fix and
  re-scanning comes back clean instead of failing on the same noise
  forever. (50 tests.)

## 0.1.1 — 2026-11-11

- Docs: README now has npm version, CI, license and Node badges, and the
  example output is regenerated verbatim — its paths match the repo layout.
- Fix: the demo build and the cache test fixture now simulate 400 ms of
  work (was 150 ms), so the cache check's verdict stays decisive even on
  loaded CI machines — 0.1.1's first CI run failed one job (macOS, Node 22)
  because a 41 ms saving fell under the 50 ms "cache pays" threshold.
- Fix: `all` on a repo with no build cache no longer ends in FAIL — a
  build command with no cache directory to measure is listed as skipped,
  with the `--cache-dir` hint, instead of a failed cache check. (41 tests.)

## 0.1.0 — 2026-11-10

- First release: one CLI combining the four diagnostic checks.
- `context` — context-noise scan (from ai-context-doctor).
- `path` — missing-command diagnosis across shells and toolchains
  (from cli-path-doctor).
- `cache` — cold vs warm build timing (from cache-verdict).
- `flakes` — flaky-test ranking from JUnit XML (from flake-ledger).
- `all` — all four checks in one unified report.
