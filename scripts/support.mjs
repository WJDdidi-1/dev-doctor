 * tempDir() is mkdtempSync with cleanup: the directory is removed
 * after the test that created it, so repeated suite runs cannot fill
 * /tmp (a 512 MB tmpfs on this machine — the suite used to leak ~100
 * MB per run and started failing once /tmp filled up). The `after`
 * hook runs even when the test fails, so a failing test still cleans
 * up after itself.
